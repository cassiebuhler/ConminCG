## WHAT THE CODE DOES 

This code generates random problems that are solved with Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM) with Cubic Regularization.

## HOW TO USE IT

The driver code is the file *huber_Example.py*. Run this file. 

1. **MODIFY PROBLEM SIZE**

To change the problem size, you can modify *m* and *n*. 

2. **MODIFY NUMBER OF PROBLEMS**

We run the problem 100 times by using a for loop. To change the number of problems, modify the *rr* variable.
